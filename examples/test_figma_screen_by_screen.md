# 🎯 **Figma Screen-by-Screen Processing Test Guide**

## ✅ **Phase 1 Implementation Complete!**

The screen-by-screen processing for large Figma files (44k+ nodes) is now fully implemented and integrated with LLM processing.

### 🏗️ **What's Implemented:**

**✅ Complete Screen-by-Screen Processing:**
- ✅ **Large File Detection**: Automatically detects files > 10k nodes
- ✅ **Structure Analysis**: Analyzes file structure for screens/frames
- ✅ **Screen Extraction**: Extracts individual screens from large files
- ✅ **Screen Processing**: Processes each screen separately through LLM
- ✅ **Component Deduplication**: Removes duplicate components across screens
- ✅ **Navigation Generation**: Creates app navigation structure
- ✅ **LLM Integration**: Full integration with Gemini 2.5 Pro processing

**✅ Intelligent Processing Logic:**
- ✅ **Automatic Mode Selection**: Chooses screen-by-screen vs standard processing
- ✅ **Quality Preservation**: No data loss, full traceability
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of individual screen failures
- ✅ **Result Merging**: Combines results from all screens

## 🚀 **Testing with Postman**

### **Test 1: Extract File Key**
```http
POST http://localhost:6000/api/v1/figma/extract-file-key?figma_url=YOUR_FIGMA_URL
Headers:
  X-API-Key: test-api-key
```

### **Test 2: Process Large Figma File**
```http
POST http://localhost:6000/api/v1/figma/process-url
Headers:
  X-API-Key: test-api-key
  Content-Type: application/json

Body:
{
  "figma_url": "YOUR_FIGMA_URL",
  "user_message": "Create a modern dashboard application",
  "framework": "react",
  "backend_framework": "nodejs"
}
```

### **Expected Response for Large Files:**

        "route": "/login",
        "component": "LoginScreen"
      }
    ]
  },
  "frontend_code": { /* Combined frontend code */ },
  "backend_code": { /* Combined backend code */ },
  "components": [ /* All components */ ],
  "statistics": {
    "total_screens": 2,

  }
}
```

## 🎯 **Key Features for Large Files:**

### **1. Automatic Detection**
- Files > 10k nodes automatically trigger screen-by-screen processing
- No manual configuration needed

### **2. Screen-by-Screen Processing**
- Each screen processed independently
- Individual screen failures don't break the entire process
- Full error handling and reporting

### **3. Component Management**
- Shared components extracted and deduplicated
- Reusable components identified across screens
- Clean component architecture

### **4. Navigation Structure**
- Automatic route generation
- React Router integration
- Screen-to-component mapping

### **5. Quality Preservation**
- Original data preserved
- Full traceability
- No data loss
- Complete processing logs
